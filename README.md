# A rpg project using JavaFX
One of my favorite project to make. This is a project that uses Java and the JavaFX library to show that using basic coding concepts it is possible to make a small and fun game to play.

Installation: Should be as easy as throwing the src zip into a project and unzipping, use
JavaFX Library as well

Directions: Choose any map size from the main menu, using more than 10x10 makes the
tiles very small and may start to look odd. Important! Use W A S D to move around, but
before you do that press any button preferably E to look around first! (E is the closest
button) Be sure to rearrange each window that pops up to your liking, the window
you use to shoot with will give you notifications about what is around you, so be sure to
press E when starting off
